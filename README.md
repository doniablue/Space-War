# Backstory 
The reason why they're fighting is because the enemyship was making your mama jokes and he was taking it way too far.
The spaceship got mad at the enemyship because he was talking bad about his mom. The enemyship told him "Dude chill out, it's
just a joke." The spaceship replied back and said "That's not something you should be joking about. that's my mom your talking
about. The enemyship got mad started shooting at him and that's how they're in this mess.
